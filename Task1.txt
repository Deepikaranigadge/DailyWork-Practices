🟨 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
It runs inside the browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and is a core part of web development, along with HTML and CSS.

⚙️ Key Features of JavaScript:
Client-side scripting language (also used on the server side with Node.js).

Interpreted, not compiled — runs directly in browsers.

Dynamically typed — no need to define data types explicitly.

Prototype-based — uses prototypes instead of classes (though ES6 introduced class syntax).

Event-driven & asynchronous — uses callbacks, promises, and async/await.

☕ What is Java?
Java is a compiled, object-oriented programming language used for building desktop applications, backend systems, Android apps, and enterprise software.
It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

🔍 Difference Between Java and JavaScript
Feature	Java	JavaScript
Type	Object-oriented, compiled language	Scripting, interpreted language
Execution	Runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine)	Runs in browser or Node.js
Typing	Statically typed (data types declared)	Dynamically typed
Syntax	Class-based	Prototype-based (ES6 classes are syntactic sugar)
Use Case	Backend systems, Android apps, desktop software	Web interactivity, frontend development, server-side (Node.js)
Compilation	Needs compilation before running	Executed line by line by browser
Performance	Usually faster (compiled)	Slightly slower (interpreted)
Platform Dependence	“Write once, run anywhere” via JVM	Runs anywhere with a browser
🧠 Simple Example
JavaScript:

console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
Java:

public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
  }
}
✅ In short:

Despite their similar names, Java and JavaScript are completely different languages.
Java is for general-purpose programming, while JavaScript is mainly for web interactivity.

Would you like me to give a real-world analogy to remember the difference easily?

Let’s go step by step 👇

🟨 1. Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript data types are divided into two main categories:

🔹 Primitive (Basic) Data Types
🔹 Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
🧩 Primitive Data Types
Primitive types are basic, immutable (cannot be changed), and store single values.
There are 7 primitive data types in JavaScript:

Data Type	Example	Description

String	        "Hello"	                Represents text data
Number	        42, 3.14	            Represents both integers and floating-point numbers
Boolean	        true, false	            Represents logical values
Undefined	    let x;	                A variable declared but not assigned any value
Null	        let y = null;	        Represents intentional absence of a value
Symbol (ES6)	let id = Symbol("id");	Used for unique identifiers

Example:
let name = "Deepika";      // String
let age = 22;              // Number
let isStudent = true;      // Boolean
let address;               // Undefined
let salary = null;         // Null
let id = Symbol("id");     // Symbol
let bigNum = 9876543210123456789n; // BigInt

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

Non-primitive types are objects that can store multiple values or complex data.
They are mutable (can be changed).

Data Type	Example	Description
Object	              { name: "Deepika", age: 22 }	Collection of key–value pairs
Array	              [1, 2, 3]	                    Ordered list of values
Function	          function greet(){}	        Block of code designed to perform a task
Date, Map, Set, etc.  new Date()	                Built-in object types

Example:
let person = { name: "Deepika", age: 22 }; // Object
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];     // Array
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}                                          // Function


3) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

1) var
Introduced in ES5 and earlier.
Has function scope (or global scope if declared outside a function).
Can be re-declared and updated.
Hoisted (moved to the top of the scope) but initialized as undefined.

Example:
var name = "Deepika";
var name = "Rani"; // ✅ Re-declaration allowed
name = "Priya";    // ✅ Re-assignment allowed
console.log(name); // "Priya"


2)let

Introduced in ES6 (2015).
Has block scope (limited to { ... }).
Can be updated, but not re-declared in the same scope.
Hoisted, but not initialized (in temporal dead zone until declared).

Example:
let city = "Delhi";
city = "Mumbai"; // ✅ Can update
// let city = "Pune"; ❌ Cannot re-declare in same scope

3) const

Also introduced in ES6 (2015).
Has block scope.
Cannot be re-declared or updated.
Must be initialized when declared.

Example:
const country = "India";
// country = "USA"; ❌ Error - cannot reassign

4) What is hoisting?
Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved (or “hoisted”) to the top of their scope before code execution.
So you can use variables and functions before declaring them, but their behavior depends on how they were declared.

Example 1: Using var
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

Using let or const
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 20;

Example: Function Hoisting
greet(); // ✅ Works

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

| Type                 | Hoisted?                  | Usable Before Declaration? |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `var`                | Yes                       | ✅ (value = `undefined`)    |
| `let` / `const`      | Yes                       | ❌ (TDZ error)              |
| Function Declaration | Yes (fully)               | ✅ Yes                      |
| Function Expression  | Partially (variable only) | ❌ No                       |


5) What is the difference between == and ===?Example 1: Using var

Both == and === are comparison operators,
but they behave differently when comparing values and data types.

 1. == (Loose Equality Operator)

Compares only the values, not the data types.
If the data types are different, JavaScript automatically converts (coerces) them before comparison.

Example:
5 == "5"     // true  (string converted to number)
0 == false    // true  (false converted to 0)
null == undefined // true


2. === (Strict Equality Operator)

Compares both value and data type.
No type conversion happens.

Example:
5 === "5"     // false  (different types)
0 === false    // false
5 === 5        // true

| Feature             | `==` (Loose Equality)    | `===` (Strict Equality) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
|   Checks            | Value only               | Value + Type            |
|   Type Conversion   | Yes                      | No                      |
|   Performance       | Slower (does conversion) | Faster                  |
|   Example           | `5 == "5"` → ✅ true     | `5 === "5"` → ❌ false |


5) What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?

Truthy and Falsy Values in JavaScript
In JavaScript, every value is either truthy or falsy when evaluated in a Boolean context (like in if, while, or logical operators).

Falsy Values

A falsy value is a value that becomes false when converted to a Boolean.
There are only 7 falsy values in JavaScript:

| Falsy Value          | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `false`              | The Boolean false             |
| `0`                  | Number zero                   |
| `-0`                 | Negative zero                 |
| `""` or `''` or ```` | Empty string                  |
| `null`               | Represents no value           |
| `undefined`          | Variable not assigned a value |
| `NaN`                | Not-a-Number                  |

Example:
if (0) {
  console.log("Truthy");
} else {
  console.log("Falsy");
}
// Output: Falsy

Truthy Values

A truthy value is anything that is not falsy.
So all other values are truthy — including non-empty strings, numbers (except 0), objects, arrays, etc.

Example:
if ("Hello") console.log("Truthy");      // non-empty string
if (42) console.log("Truthy");           // number (not 0)
if ([]) console.log("Truthy");           // empty array
if ({}) console.log("Truthy");           // empty object
if ("0") console.log("Truthy");          // string containing zero

In short:

Falsy: false, 0, -0, "", null, undefined, NaN
Truthy: Everything else (e.g. non-empty strings, arrays, objects, numbers ≠ 0)

7) What is the use of the typeof operator?

typeof Operator in JavaScript

The typeof operator is used to find the data type of a value or variable.
It returns the type as a string.

Syntax:
typeof variableName

Example:
typeof "Hello";      // "string"
typeof 42;           // "number"
typeof true;         // "boolean"
typeof undefined;    // "undefined"
typeof null;         // ⚠️ "object"  (this is a known JS bug)
typeof {name: "Deepika"}; // "object"
typeof [1, 2, 3];    // "object"  (arrays are objects)
typeof function() {}; // "function"
typeof Symbol("id"); // "symbol"
typeof 123n;         // "bigint"

Example of Condition:
let value = 100;

if (typeof value === "number") {
  console.log("It's a number!");
}

8) What is NaN and how can you check for it?

NaN stands for "Not-a-Number".
It is a special numeric value that represents the result of an invalid or undefined mathematical operation.

Example:

console.log(0 / 0);          // NaN
console.log("abc" * 5);      // NaN
console.log(parseInt("abc")); // NaN


| Method                | Description                     | Example               | Result  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| `isNaN(value)`        | Converts to number, then checks | `isNaN("abc")`        | ✅ true  |
| `Number.isNaN(value)` | Strict check (no conversion)    | `Number.isNaN("abc")` | ❌ false |
| `NaN === NaN`         | Direct comparison               | `NaN === NaN`         | ❌ false |


9) What is the difference between undefined and null?

| Feature                |   undefined                                               |   null                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   Meaning              | A variable has been **declared but not assigned** a value | A variable has been **explicitly assigned “no value”** |
|   Type                 | `"undefined"`                                             | `"object"` (this is a historical JavaScript bug)       |
|   Set by               | JavaScript itself                                         | The programmer (you)                                   |
|   Use case             | Indicates a **missing or uninitialized value**            | Represents an **empty or intentionally missing value** |
|   Example              | `let a; console.log(a); // undefined`                     | `let b = null; console.log(b); // null`                |
|   Boolean Conversion   | `Boolean(undefined)` → `false`                            | `Boolean(null)` → `false`                              |

Example:
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined (no value assigned)

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null (explicitly assigned)

10) What is type coercion in JavaScript?

Type coercion in JavaScript means automatically converting one data type to another when an operation involves different types (like string + number).

In simple words:
JavaScript automatically changes the type of a value to make the operation possible.

Types of Type Coercion

There are two main types:

Implicit Coercion – done automatically by JavaScript
Explicit Coercion – done manually by the developer

Implicit Type Coercion (Automatic)
This happens when JavaScript automatically converts data types during an operation.

Example 1: String + Number
let result = "5" + 2;
console.log(result); // "52"  → number 2 is converted to string

Explicit Type Coercion (Manual)
You manually convert one type to another using built-in functions.

Example:
Number("10");   // converts string to number → 10
String(20);     // converts number to string → "20"
Boolean(0);     // converts number to boolean → false
