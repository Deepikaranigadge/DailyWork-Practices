What is OOP in Python?===============================
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring code using classes and objects to model real-world entities.

Why do we need Classes and Objects
i)Supports object-oriented programming using reusable templates (classes) and real-world models (objects).
ii)Enables key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
It helps in:Modularity – Code is organized into reusable components.
Reusability – Classes can be reused and extended.
Maintainability – Easier to update and debug.
Class and Object
Class: ==Blueprint for creating objects. defined thier properties and method
Object:== Instance of a class.
Encapsulation:== bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting access to some components to control interactions.
Inheritance: == Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism:== Same method name, different behavior depending on the object.
Abstraction:== hide the internal implementation details of a class and expose only the necessary features to the outside.

Using __init__() Function
In Python, class has __init__() function which automatically initializes object attributes when an object is created.
 The __init__() method is the constructor in Python.

Self Parameter
self parameter is a reference to the current instance of class. 
It allows us to access the attributes and methods of the object.

Method Overloading : Python does not support true method overloading (same method name with different parameter lists).
If you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition overrides the previous ones.

Method Overriding : when a child class defines a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its parent class, replacing its behavior.

The super() : function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (superclass) inside a child (subclass).
You can still call the parent method using super().

super().__init__() initializes the inherited attributes without rewriting the parent’s constructor.

1)What is JSON===============================

Use Case:1) It's lightweigth data format used for storing and exchanging data.
2)Commonly used in API's and web application
3)Data transfer between frontend & backend , mobileApp & Server
4)Import/Export Data used for exporting and importing data between sysytems

2)What is Decorator=============================

Decorator is a function that adds extra feature before and after a function.
without modifiying it's original code
syntax: @decorator_name 
Use Case:1)Logging = Track when a function starts and ends.
2)Authorization = Used in Flask / Django to check login before accessing a page.
3)Time Measurement = Used to measure how long a function takes to run.
4)Retry logic = Automatically retry when function fails (network, API calls).

3)What is lambda ================================
 Lambda functions are small anonymous functions in Python.
  It has single expressions and accepts multiples arguments.
Use Case:1)To avoid writing full def functions
2)Commonly used with map(), filter(), reduce(), sorting, and data processing.
3)One - line function
4)code becomes cleaner
map() = applies a function (often lambda) to every element of an iterable and returns a new iterable.
Example: result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(result)   # [2, 4, 6, 8]
filter() = it keeps only the items that satisfy the condition.
Example: result = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))
print(result)   # [2, 4, 6]
reduce() = it combines all items into single value
Example: from functools import reduce
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(result)   # 10

4)What is Clouser in python ==========================================
A function inside another function(nested function)
The inner function refence variable from the outer function.
The outer function return the inner function
Use case: 1)Decorators: Python decorators often rely on closures to modify or extend the behavior of functions.
2)Creating stateful functions
(e.g., counters, click trackers, API call counters)
3)Data hiding / Encapsulation
(store sensitive data like balance, tokens, config inside closure)

5)What is the purpose of nonlocal in closures?===================================
Used to modify outer function variables inside the inner function.

6) Different between Module, framework, file, library, package=================
1️⃣ File
A file is simply a physical document on the system.
In Python, a .py file containing code is treated as a script.
Example: script.py, data.txt, config.json
2️⃣ Module
A module is a single Python file (.py) that contains functions, classes, or variables and can be imported.
Example: math.py, os.py, re.py
3️⃣ Package
A package is a folder that contains multiple modules and has an __init__.py file.
A library is a collection of packages and modules that provide reusable functionality.
Examples: NumPy (math operations), Pandas (data analysis), Requests (API calls)
5️⃣ Framework
A framework is a large structure that provides a full environment and imposes rules for building applications.
Examples: Django, Flask, FastAPI

7)What is an Operator in Python? ====================================================

An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on values or variables.
Types of Operators in Python
1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators :Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Floor division,Modulus
2️⃣Comparison (Relational) Operators = Used to compare values. Returns True/False.
Equal to, Not equal, Greater than, Less than, Greater or equal, Less or equal
3️⃣Logical Operators = Used to combine conditions.
and	 = True if both are True , or	 = True if one is True , not = 	Reverses boolean
4️⃣ Assignment Operators = Used to assign values.
5️⃣ Bitwise Operators = AND, XOR, NOT, Left shift, Right shift
6️⃣Identity Operators = Check if two objects refer to the same memory location
7️⃣Membership Operators = Check for membership in sequences like lists, strings, or tuples

What is Module in python ====================================

A file contains Python definitions, functions, classes, and statements.
1)Built in module = module that provide standard functionality like methemetical Operators, file i/o, etc.
2)External Modules = modules that are installed via external package using tool like pip
3)Custom Modules = create our own modules by saving python code in .py.
