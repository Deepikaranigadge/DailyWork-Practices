1)You are given a number N, you need to print its multiplication table.

def multiplicationTable(N):

 for i in range(1, 11):
    print(N * i, end=" ")

OUTPUT
Input:
N = 5
Output:
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50    

2)You are given a string s, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).
def stringJumper(s):
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        print(s[i], end="")

OUTPUT:DoctorPhenomenal
DcoPeoea        

3)Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.
def printInDecreasing(x):
    # code here
 while x >= 0:
        print(x, end=" ")
        x -= 1

OUTPUT:
Input: x = 3
Output: 3 2 1 0
Explanation:
Numbers in decreasing order from 3
are 3, 2, 1, 0.

4)Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).
def printIncreasingPower(x):
 
    # Loop to jump in powers of 2
 i = 1
 while i * i <= x:
    print(i * i, end=" ")
    i += 1
        
OUTPUT:
Input: x = 10
Output: 1 4 9
Explanation:From 1 to 10, numbers in powers of 2 are, 12, 22, 32 as 1, 4 and 9.

5)You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive.
If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function.
If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.
def zero(n):
    if n == 0:
        print ("already Zero")
    
def pos(n):
    for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
        print(i,end = " ")
    
def neg(n):
    for i in range(n,1,1):
        print(i,end = " ")

OUTPUT:
4

3 2 1 0

6)Here one integer n is given. You need to write the complete function returnValueFunction
 that takes n as a parameter and uses the return keyword to return double the value of n.
def returnValueFunction(n):
    return 2*n
OUTPUT:
n =2
4

7)This problem has no input. You need to write the function helloFunction that prints Hello

def helloFunction():
    print("Hello")

OUTPUT:
Input: 
None

Hello
    
8)Here two integers a and b are given. The given input and its values are passed as arguments to the function argumentFunction.
 The argumentFunction is responsible to return (a+b). You need to write this function.
def argumentFunction(a, b):
    return a+ b   
OUTPUT:
a = 2, b = 3
5

9)Given a number n, find the first digit of the number
def firstDigit(n):
    i = str(n)
    
    return i[0]

OUTPUT:n = 123
1    

10)Print GFG n times without the loop.
class Solution:
    def printGfg(self, n):
        if n == 0:
            return
        print("GFG", end=" ")
        self.printGfg(n - 1)
OUTPUT:10
GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
